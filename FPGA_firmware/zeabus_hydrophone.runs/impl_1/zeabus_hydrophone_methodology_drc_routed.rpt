TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT slave_fifo/fifo_departure_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-190#1 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDRE cell slave_fifo/fifo_departure/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d2_reg in site SLICE_X18Y119 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDSE cell slave_fifo/fifo_departure/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gconvfifo.rf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d3_reg is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
