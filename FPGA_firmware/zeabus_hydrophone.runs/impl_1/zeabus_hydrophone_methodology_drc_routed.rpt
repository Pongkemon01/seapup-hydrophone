TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT slave_fifo/fifo_departure_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks

It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_gen/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#41 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_64mhz_clk_pll is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 6 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_gen/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#42 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_64mhz_clk_pll is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 7 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_gen/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#43 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_64mhz_clk_pll is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 8 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_gen/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0]

TIMING-28#44 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock clk_64mhz_clk_pll is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 9 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins clk_gen/inst/plle2_adv_inst/CLKOUT0]
