2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell slave_fifo/fifo_departure_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) slave_fifo/fifo_arrival/RST, slave_fifo/fifo_departure/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell trigger/FIFO36E1_inst_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) trigger/FIFO36E1_inst/RST. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.356 ns between adc2/filter1/avg_binning1/d_out_reg[2]/C (clocked by sys_clk) and trigger/t_counter_reg[10]/R (clocked by sys_clk).
